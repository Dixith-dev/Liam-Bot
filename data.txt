The competition in the market
The target market for the chatbot
Ultimately, the price of a chatbot will vary depending on the specific needs of the business. However, Evans's suggestions can provide a good starting point for businesses that are considering developing or purchasing a chatbot.

The number of users

The frequency of updates
The level of support that is required
It is important to factor in all of these costs when pricing a chatbot. By doing so, businesses can ensure that they are getting a fair price for a chatbot that meets their needs.

summary :- link :- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDnvUAtI0RE) The average employee in the US wastes 3 hours every day at work. This costs businesses hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
There are companies that pay chief automation officers (CAOs) hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to implement automation strategies. However, this is not feasible for small to medium-sized businesses.
The speaker proposes a solution: small businesses can hire freelancers to build AI-powered automation solutions. This is a much more affordable option and can save businesses a lot of money.
The speaker provides an example of how this can be done. They say that a gym could hire a freelancer to build a chatbot that provides personalized workout plans and nutrition advice to members. This would help to increase retention and save the gym money on staff costs.
The speaker also says that automations can be used for other tasks, such as lead nurturing and customer onboarding.
The speaker concludes by saying that this is a great opportunity for freelancers who are skilled in AI and automation.
Here are some additional points that the speaker makes in the video:



The speaker says that the demand for AI-powered automation solutions is growing. This is because businesses are increasingly looking for ways to save money and improve efficiency.
The speaker also says that the barrier to entry for freelancers is low. This is because there are many platforms and tools that make it easy to build automations.
The speaker encourages freelancers to start by targeting small businesses. This is because small businesses are more likely to be open to new ideas and willing to pay for automation solutions.
Overall, the video provides a good overview of the opportunity for freelancers in the AI-powered automation space. If you are skilled in AI and automation, this could be a great way to start your own business or find freelance work.

Here are some key points from the video:

Confidence is key. If you believe in your skills and services, you will be more likely to charge a higher price.
Be conscious of your clients' budget. Don't overpromise and underdeliver.
Don't be afraid to ask what your clients' budget is. This will help you to create a proposal that is within their reach.
Overdeliver on your promises. This will build trust with your clients and make them more likely to pay you more money in the future.

Do your research and understand your clients' needs.

It is also important to be flexible with your pricing. Be willing to negotiate with clients and offer discounts for larger projects or long-term contracts.
Finally, remember that pricing is just one part of the equation. You also need to provide excellent customer service and deliver high-quality work in order to keep your clients happy and coming back for more.

Liam evans latest video :- link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSo8qPTT30) titile:- "We're Evolving Our AI Automation Agency, Here's Why" Summary:- The video titled "We're Evolving Our AI Automation Agency, Here's Why" by Liam Evans discusses the evolution of AI automation agencies and the challenges they face. Liam starts by comparing traditional Facebook Ads agencies to AI automation agencies. He points out that while Facebook Ads agencies can easily replicate their services across different industries, AI automation agencies struggle with this due to the need for customized solutions for each client.

Liam identifies the problem of scalability, especially when serving multiple industries. Each new client requires a unique set of bots and automations, making it difficult to scale the business. He shares his own experience of receiving numerous leads but finding it challenging to provide consistent value across different industries.

The solution, according to Liam, is "productizing" the services. By focusing on a specific industry, agencies can create a master template of bots and automations that can be easily replicated for new clients within that industry. This not only saves time but also allows the agency to offer services at a lower cost, attracting more clients.

He emphasizes the importance of becoming an expert in a chosen field. Once you have a successful product for one client, it can be adapted for others in the same industry, eliminating the need for a discovery period for each new client. Liam also talks about the possibility of creating tiered pricing models, offering both standard and custom solutions.

Towards the end, Liam hints at the transformation of his agency into an AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) company. He suggests that once you have productized solutions, you can even consider running paid ads to attract more clients. This could eventually lead to having a tangible business that could be sold or exited.

Overall, the video serves as a guide for AI automation agencies looking to scale and productize their services.

Chatbots and automations for B2B business owners

1. Lead Qualification
Use Case: Instead of sales representatives spending time qualifying leads, an AI chatbot can ask preliminary questions to determine the potential of a lead. This ensures that only high-quality leads are passed on to the sales team.
Setup: Integrate a chatbot on the company website or landing pages. Program the bot with a series of questions designed to gauge the interest and potential of a visitor. Integrate the bot with the CRM to automatically update lead scores or categorizations.
Savings:
Time: High (Sales reps can focus on already qualified leads)
Money: Moderate (Efficient lead handling can lead to higher conversion rates)
2. Customer Support
Use Case: Address common queries or issues without the need for a human representative. This can include troubleshooting, billing questions, or product inquiries.
Setup: Implement a chatbot on the support page or in the support section of the product. Feed the bot with a knowledge base or FAQ to answer common questions. For complex issues, the bot can create a ticket or escalate to a human representative.
Savings:
Time: High (Reduces the number of basic inquiries to human agents)
Money: High (Fewer customer support representatives needed)
3. Order and Inventory Inquiries
Use Case: B2B clients often need to check the status of their orders or the availability of inventory. A chatbot can provide real-time updates without human intervention.
Setup: Integrate the chatbot with the order management system or inventory database. Ensure the bot can recognize and respond to queries about order status or stock levels.
Savings:
Time: Moderate (Automates order and inventory checks)
Money: Moderate (Reduces the need for staff to handle these inquiries)

4. Booking Meetings and Demos
Use Case: Instead of back-and-forth emails to schedule meetings or product demos, a chatbot can check availability and book slots.
Setup: Integrate the chatbot with calendar software (e.g., Google Calendar, Outlook). Allow the bot to access available slots and book meetings based on user preferences.
Savings:
Time: High (Eliminates manual scheduling)
Money: Low (Saves administrative time but not a significant cost reduction)
5. Onboarding New Clients
Use Case: When a new client signs up, a chatbot can guide them through the initial setup, gather necessary information, and provide introductory materials.
Setup: Program the chatbot with the onboarding process steps, integrate it with the CRM to store client information, and link it to resources or training materials.
Savings:
Time: Moderate (Streamlines the onboarding process)
Money: Low (Reduces some manual tasks but doesn't replace significant costs)
6. Feedback Collection
Use Case: After a sale, demo, or interaction, a chatbot can collect feedback, which is crucial for improving B2B offerings.
Setup: Integrate the chatbot with survey tools or directly program it to ask feedback questions. Store responses in a database or CRM for analysis.
Savings:
Time: Low (Automates feedback collection)
Money: Low (Might reduce the need for third-party survey tools)

Popularity of ChatGPT: Since its launch, ChatGPT has gained immense popularity, reaching over 100 million people using the tool weekly. This rapid adoption made it one of the fastest consumer products to hit the 100 million monthly user mark​​.

GPT-4 Turbo: An upgraded version of the GPT-4 model, named GPT-4 Turbo, was unveiled. This new model is more capable and cheaper, offering two versions - one for text analysis and another for both text and image understanding. The GPT-4 Turbo boasts a significantly larger context window of 128,000 tokens (about 100,000 words), four times more than the previous GPT-4's window. It also has a more recent knowledge cut-off of April 2023​​.

Personalized GPT Models: OpenAI announced the ability for users to create their own GPT models for various purposes, without needing coding skills. Additionally, enterprise customers can create internal-only GPTs based on OpenAI's knowledge base, and developers can integrate these models with external databases or knowledge sources​​.

GPT Store: A new initiative to let users publish their custom GPT models to a store was revealed. Initially, this store will feature creations from verified builders, and OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman discussed plans to compensate creators of popular GPT models​​.

Assistants API: OpenAI introduced a new Assistants API, allowing developers to create their own agent-like experiences.
